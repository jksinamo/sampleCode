Status: webcrawl works as intended, but need to fix the domestic outlinks filter

Disclaimer: This is NOT the entirity of a kit for hyperlink analysis, rather a crawler to fetch an appropriate set of data for calculations of hyperlink analysis. Such kit for calculations of network centralities and measurements are available via NetworkX package in Python which accept the output resulted from my code

Note  : More test cases will be added to webcrawl_test
